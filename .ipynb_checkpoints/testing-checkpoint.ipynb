      "📊 INTENT ANALYSIS (Temp: 0.2):\n",
      " ## Message Type\n",
      "Boldly provocative, attention-seeking\n",
      "\n",
      "## Likely Tone & Mindset\n",
      "She's likely aiming for a reaction – shock, intrigue, or amusement. There’s a strong desire to be perceived as unapologetically herself and potentially a little rebellious. She's probably seeking validation for her choices, even if subtly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Subtext / Personality Clues\n",
      "This is a highly unconventional opening line. It indicates a high degree of confidence (or a calculated attempt to project it), a willingness to be blunt, and possibly a playful disregard for social norms. It could also signal a desire for someone who isn’t easily intimidated or offended. There's a strong element of testing the waters – gauging how you’ll react to such directness. She's likely comfortable with sexual topics and isn't afraid of a little risk in dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Response Suggestion\n",
      "Acknowledge the boldness without mirroring it directly. A witty, slightly intrigued response that doesn't demand a detailed explanation is best. Something like, \"Well, that’s certainly…a story. Intrigued to hear more (or not, haha).\" This validates her directness while keeping the conversation light.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Spelling / Slang Notes\n",
      "\"Fucked\" is used casually, indicating a comfortable and potentially sexually liberated attitude. The phrasing \"went back to my ex\" is deliberately understated, adding to the unexpected nature of the message. It's a concise way of conveying a shift in relationship status without dwelling on the details.\n",
      "\n",
      " 🚩 RED FLAG DETECTION:\n",
      " Here's the analysis of that message, evaluated through the provided framework:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Emotional Instability:** Suggests impulsive behavior & difficulty with emotional consequences, potentially indicating a lack of emotional regulation.\n",
      "*   **Accountability Avoidance:** Blaming/shifting responsibility for actions (\"fucked this dude\") without acknowledging potential consequences.\n",
      "*   **Unresolved Connections:** Returning to an ex implies difficulty in processing past relationships, potentially hindering future growth.\n",
      "*   **Blame Deflection:** Implies a lack of self-reflection regarding the choices made, suggesting difficulty taking responsibility.\n",
      "*   **Attention-Seeking:** The bluntness could be a tactic to elicit a reaction/validation, indicating an attention-seeking tendency.\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "🎯 STRATEGY (Temp: 0.7):\n",
      "## Best Tone\n",
      "Guarded curiosity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mirror tone\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Escalation of Flirtation\n",
      "Light teasing\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strategy Breakdown\n",
      "Mirror the bluntness with a playful, slightly intrigued response. This tests her boundaries while subtly gauging her emotional maturity; keep it light to avoid over-investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why This Works\n",
      "The mirrored tone assesses if her boldness is genuine confidence or a tactic for attention. Light teasing maintains playful tension without escalating; the goal is to see how she responds to a slightly unexpected, but not overly intense, reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ending Style\n",
      "Open-ended\n",
      "💬 REPLY OPTIONS (Temp: 0.95):\n",
      "Alright, here are three replies based on that message and the strategy. Let's see where this goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Whoa. Okay. That’s… a story. 😮‍💨\n",
      "2.  Alright, you’re definitely not boring. Spill. 😉\n",
      "3.  Interesting. So, the ex came back? 👀\n",
