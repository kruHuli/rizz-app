      "📊 INTENT ANALYSIS (Temp: 0.2):\n",
      " ## Message Type\n",
      "Playful jab with flirtatious intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Likely Tone & Mindset\n",
      "Confident, playful, and seeking connection. She's likely comfortable with a direct, slightly edgy communication style.  She’s aiming for a lighthearted, potentially flirty interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Subtext / Personality Clues\n",
      "The use of \"bitch\" is a significant indicator. While potentially intended playfully (common in younger demographics), it suggests she's comfortable with boundary-pushing communication and isn’t afraid to be assertive. The \"miss yaaa\" adds a layer of vulnerability mixed with playful exaggeration – she's fishing for a response and enjoys a bit of attention. This indicates a confident personality that isn’t afraid to initiate or lead the interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Response Suggestion\n",
      "Acknowledge the playful tone and reciprocate with a similarly confident response. Something like, \"Miss you too, you little hellcat.\"  This validates her energy while matching it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Spelling / Slang Notes\n",
      "\"Whatsup\" is a casual greeting, common in digital communication. \"Bitch\" here is likely not meant literally as an insult but rather as a term of endearment or playful familiarity within her social circle. The multiple \"a\"s in \"miss yaaa\" amplify the sentiment, emphasizing her desire for connection.\n",
      "\n",
      " 🚩 RED FLAG DETECTION:\n",
      " Here's an analysis of the message, evaluated through the provided framework:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Disrespectful language (\"bitch\"):** Contradicts respect & boundaries; suggests a lack of consideration for the other person.\n",
      "*   **Emotional Immaturity:** Overly casual & overly familiar tone; lacks emotional regulation, potentially indicating instability.\n",
      "*   **Attention-Seeking:** The exaggerated \"miss yaaa\" could be a performative attempt to elicit a reaction.\n",
      "*   **Accountability Avoidance:** The casualness deflects responsibility for maintaining the connection, hinting at potential avoidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "🎯 STRATEGY (Temp: 0.6):\n",
      "## Best Tone\n",
      "Flirty\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mirror tone\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Escalation of Flirtation\n",
      "Light teasing\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strategy Breakdown\n",
      "Mirroring her confident, slightly provocative tone builds rapport. The playful escalation acknowledges her communication style while subtly testing her boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why This Works\n",
      "The mirroring strategy establishes a connection by reflecting her energy. The light teasing gauges her reaction to playful banter, offering insight into her comfort level with flirtation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ending Style\n",
      "Open-ended\n",
      "💬 REPLY OPTIONS (Temp: 0.85):\n",
      "Alright, let's craft some replies for Kruthik. Here are 3 options based on the strategy, assuming a generally engaged and confident vibe from the original message. We'll keep it flirty and escalate slightly with light teasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  You know I miss *you*. What have you been up to, trouble? 😉\n",
      "2.  Bitch, you're speaking my language. What kind of mischief are we talking? 😈\n",
      "3.  Missin' the chaos. Hit me with your best offer. 😏\n",
