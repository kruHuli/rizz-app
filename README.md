Hey, if you're reading this... why?

But if you insist on reading this, this is my attempt to build agents to help me text girls on a dating app. 

I am terrible at texting and even worse at picking up subtle hints, so this is where the bots come in. 
Running on Gemma 3n E4B locally, I want to create a bot that will analyze a person's text, tell me if there are any red flags I've predefined, and come up with a strategy to 
1. Understand the intent behind messages and recommend 3 messages so I don't "fumble the bag" when I'm confused by a message.
2. Initiate and maintian a conversation
